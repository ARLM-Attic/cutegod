	* Updated a cutegod script to run the game and some sanity checks
	on the Linux environment before running.

	* Massive organization on the file structures, including splitting
	out CuteGod from the Sprite3 library. Also updating for changes in
	the Sprite3 libraries to handle animation.

	* Changed asset loading to be based on dynamic scanning of the
	directories instead of a hard-coded list of files.

	* CuteGod/sounds.xml removed in favor of dynamically scanning
	using the AssetLoader functionality.

	* bonuses.xml, credits.xml, layouts.txt, layouts.xml, and
	penalties.xml were all moved into Resources/ to keep them out of
	the source tree and easier to find.

	* CuteGod/SoundManager.cs, CuteGod/SoundCategory.cs: Removed the
	XML reading from a resource and updated it to use a Register()
	function from the AssetLoaderSound instead. This way, the
	resources can more easily be updated, removed, and altered in a
	separate package.

	* Added a "none" to the penalty type which can always be
	selected. This just moves on without a end of stage screen.

	* Changed the Trickster penalty (+1 grab cost) to only capable of
	happening if GrabCost * 5 <= StagesStarted (remember, it starts
	with 3 already). This should reduce the frequence of the trickster
	nicely, but if you get a bunch of bonuses to reduce it, you may
	get a higher frequency of them for a bit.

	* CuteGod/Prayer.cs: Characters now bounce around a bit, as long
	as they don't jump more than a single block and height and they
	are only going in an east/west direction.

	* CuteGod/SplashMode.cs: Allowed mouse-click to turn off splash
	mode, keyboard always worked though.

	* Changed scoring so you lost hearts dropping a block, not picking
	it up.

	* The characters don't move if they haven't been accepeted, they
	just bounce up and down.
