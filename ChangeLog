	* Updated a cutegod script to run the game and some sanity checks
	on the Linux environment before running.

	* Massive organization on the file structures, including splitting
	out CuteGod from the Sprite3 library. Also updating for changes in
	the Sprite3 libraries to handle animation.

	* Changed asset loading to be based on dynamic scanning of the
	directories instead of a hard-coded list of files.
