CuteGod Prototyping Response

Welcome to the first version of the Moonfire Games answer to the Lost
Garden prototyping challenge. In specific, to the challenge
presented on the following page:

  http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/cutegod-prototyping-challenge.html

This game is still at an alpha point with not all the features
included. You'll notice that some of the menus items (Settings, High
Scores, Help) are not active at this point. However, the basic
functionality of the game is done and only the additional features and
polish that always take forever are left. That and bugs. Not that I
would say there are any, but you'll probably find one or two of them.

This game requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows and a
more recent version of Mono on Linux. Everything else should be included
in the installer. An accelerated OpenGL driver is HIGHLY recommended
since this game uses OpenGL for graphics.

Playing the Game:

  There aren't directions, but the basic idea is to answer prayers from
  the little figures on the screen. To get a prayer, click on the little
  heart speech bubble. You'll see the prayer float up and show up on the
  top of the screen. Then, you arrange the grass, water, and dirt blocks
  into the same layout as the prayer. If you do it, you'll see a little
  prayer completion dialog and get a new stage.

  Every time you move a block, you lose a heart. Later, you'll lose more
  hearts with every block. When you run out of hearts, the game is over.
  The starts you get is your score in the game.

  Enjoy!

Keyboard Commands:

  Escape: Brings you to the main menu or quits the game from the main
      menu. You can hit escape in the middle of the game and resume your
      place by clicking on the resume button from the main menu.

Credits:

  There are a bunch of credits and people who have contributed to
  helping me write this game. Most of all is Danc from Lost Garden who
  provided the graphics and the game design. It was also his challenge
  that pushed me off my seat to actually work on it. Much of the
  sounds were culled from the Internet, I gave all of them credit and
  tried to stick with CC-licensed music only. The actual links to each
  file is included in the "credits.xml" file of the source package.
